# TensorFlow Keras Basics

In this repository, we adapt the tutorials provided on the official TensorFlow website, as a way to both learn how to apply neural networks using the TensorFlow Keras framework. We add some explanations to the tutorials, or change some of the comments provided, as we see fit to make things clearer and easier to understand; and sometimes to dive deeper. 

The official tutorials can be found here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials
